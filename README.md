## Project Overview
The ATM Simulation Project is a console-based application designed to mimic the functionalities of a real Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking their account balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and changing their PIN.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login using a PIN.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Check the current account balance.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw money from the account.
- **Cash Deposit (Lodgement)**: Deposit money into the account.
- **PIN Change**: Change the account PIN.
- **Exit**: Quit the ATM session.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-simulation.git
    cd atm-simulation
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. No additional dependencies are required as this is a basic Python script.

## Usage
1. Run the ATM simulation application:
    ```bash
    python atm_simulation.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the ATM.
